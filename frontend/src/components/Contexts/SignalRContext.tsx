/**
 * SignalR provides asynchronous communication between backend and frontend. This
 * context provides functions for establishing event listeners and for accessing
 * the connection object, primarily to verify that a connection has been made.
 *
 * When registering an event handler using "registerEvent" an event name needs to be
 * provided, which must correspond to the event name used on the backend. The event
 * handler should receive a username and a message, though the username is typically
 * not relevant for broadcasted messages.
 *
 * It is important to note that event handlers can only see the scope at which they
 * are defined, which means that any React state will be outdated once they receive
 * a message. It is therefore important to update React state within these handlers
 * by passing functions in the setter functions. For instance instead of doing:
 *
 *   setState({...state, newEntry})
 *
 * we must instead do:
 *
 *   setState((oldState) => { return {...oldState, newEntry} })
 *
 * When accessing this context within another context, it is also important to make
 * sure that the other context provider is nested within the signalR context
 * provider.
 *
 * Objects are received as JSON strings. When parsing these it is important to note
 * that enums are typically encoded as numbers on the backend, and may therefore
 * need to be translated to string enums when making comparisons on the frontend.
